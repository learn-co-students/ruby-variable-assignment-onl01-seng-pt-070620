# Variable Assignment 

## Objectives

1. Assign a local variable.

## Instructions

You will assign a local variable named `greeting` that is equal to `"Hello World"`.

You should first make sure the test suite is running correctly by running `learn test`.

Upon the first run of the test suite you should see:

```
Failures:

greeting = "learn"

Finished in 0.00075 seconds (files took 0.0839 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```

To solve this test failure, create a local variable `greeting` in the `variable.rb` file. Set `greeting` equal to the string `"Hello World"`. Run `learn test` to see if you did this correctly.
